# ksh port

This is my port of the OpenBSD ksh shell for all my machines not running
OpenBSD.  It is provided AS IS, with NO WARRANTY, either expressed or implied.

Barely compiles and kinda runs on:
 - OS X 10.10
 - Linux

## Refresh
1. clone the repo for whatever branch you want:
```
cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.ca.openbsd.org:/cvs co -rOPENBSD_6_1 src/bin/ksh
```
2. hack away, diff, incorporate
3. pull request?
